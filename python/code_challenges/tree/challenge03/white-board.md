## Convert Sorted Array to BST:

### Problem Domain:

Given an integer array nums, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.
**A height-balanced binary** tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.


Input : array_nums = [0,-3,-10,5,9]
Output : [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
